# Accumulating Objects

This is a set of exercises for using the accumulator pattern with objects.

There are no tests, but there _are_ example cases available, and we recommend running [index.js](./index.js) with `node`, console.logging the return value of the function you're working on.

It might also be a good idea to comment out any example cases you aren't currently dealing with.

Good luck!
